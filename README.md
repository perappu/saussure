# Saussure - Self-hosted Character Storage

A fancy, self-hosted alternative to websites such as Toyhouse or CharacterHub, made in SvelteKit!

Intended to serve as a "headless CMS" to a frontend static website that you design.

Currently only works for GitHub as a backend and 11ty as a frontend, but support for Forgejo/Gitea is planned.

Can be simply utilized from [this version]() already hosted in the browser, as it saves your settings in localStorage. Alternatively, download it to your own computer and run it locally.

Start by cloning a repository such as [this one](), or configure your own. Then load in your personal access token and you're good to go!
